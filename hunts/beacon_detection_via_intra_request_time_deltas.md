# Beacon Detection via Intra-Request Time Deltas

**Purpose**: Find regular HTTP beaconing behavior which may indicate malware C2

**Data Required**: HTTP proxy logs

**Collection Considerations**: 

**Analysis Techniques**: Visualization (Bar graphs)

**Description**

Malware C2 often utilizes regular request intervals ("beacons") to maintain control with the attacker's infrastructure.  By examining the intra-request times between requests to the same resource by the same source IP and visualizing the results, you can look for patterns of regular activity.
